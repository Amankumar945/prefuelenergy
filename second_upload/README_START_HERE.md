This file is **HIDDEN** by default!

**To see it in cPanel:**
1. File Manager → Settings (top right)

3. Click Save

**This file is CRITICAL** - it fixes all 404 errors!

### **Server (API) - No Changes Needed**
Your API server at `api.sorsuvidhacloudsystems.com` doesn't need any updates.

**Only update:** Main domain files (`public_html`)
